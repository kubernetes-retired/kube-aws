# Create MountTargets to subnets managed by kube-aws for a pre-existing Elastic File System (Amazon EFS),
# and then mount to every node.
#
# This is for mounting an EFS to every node.
# If you'd like to mount an EFS only to a specific node pool, set `worker.nodePools[].elasticFileSystemId` instead.
#
# Enter the resource id, eg "fs-47a2c22e"
# This is a NFS share that will be available across the entire cluster through a hostPath volume on the "/efs" mountpoint
#
# You can create a new EFS volume using the CLI:
# $ aws efs create-file-system --creation-token $(uuidgen)
#
# Beware that:
# * an EFS file system can not be mounted from multiple subnets from the same availability zone and
#   therefore this feature won't work like you might have expected when you're deploying your cluster to an existing VPC and
#   wanted to mount an existing EFS to the subnet(s) created by kube-aws
#   See https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kube-aws/issues/208 for more information
# * kube-aws doesn't create MountTargets for existing subnets(=NOT managed by kube-aws). If you'd like to bring your own subnets
#   to be used by kube-aws, it is now your responsibility to configure the subnets, including creating MountTargets, accordingly
#   to your requirements
